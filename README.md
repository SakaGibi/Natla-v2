# Natla v2

Natla v2 is a refactored version of my P2P voice chat - Natla application.

## Why v2?
The original P2P mesh architecture hit scalability limits.
v2 introduces a server-based architecture to support larger rooms and better reliability.

## Planned changes
- Server-based signaling & media routing
- Improved scalability
